            <p>Basketball is a dynamic team sport that combines skill, strategy, and athleticism. Played on a rectangular court, the objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing team's hoop, which is elevated 10 feet above the ground. Each team consists of five players who work together to dribble, pass, and shoot the ball while defending against their opponents.
                Originating in the United States in 1891, basketball has grown into a global phenomenon with professional leagues such as the NBA and FIBA competitions attracting millions of fans worldwide. The sport promotes physical fitness, teamwork, and discipline, making it popular among players of all ages. Whether played casually in a park or competitively in a stadium, basketball continues to inspire and engage people around the globe.</p>
