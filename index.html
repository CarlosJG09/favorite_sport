            <p>Basketball is a dynamic team sport that combines skill, strategy, and athleticism. Played on a rectangular court, the objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing team's hoop, which is elevated 10 feet above the ground. Each team consists of five players who work together to dribble, pass, and shoot the ball while defending against their opponents.
                Originating in the United States in 1891, basketball has grown into a global phenomenon with professional leagues such as the NBA and FIBA competitions attracting millions of fans worldwide. The sport promotes physical fitness, teamwork, and discipline, making it popular among players of all ages. Whether played casually in a park or competitively in a stadium, basketball continues to inspire and engage people around the globe.</p>

                The Dallas Mavericks, often referred to as the Mavs, are a professional basketball team based in Dallas, Texas, competing in the NBA's Western Conference Southwest Division. Founded in 1980, the team initially struggled but saw significant success starting in the late 1990s with the acquisition of Dirk Nowitzki, who became the franchise's cornerstone. Under his leadership, the Mavericks reached their first NBA Finals in 2006 and won their only championship in 2011. The team has also claimed five division titles and three conference championships throughout its history, showcasing its competitive presence in the league.
                In recent years, the Mavericks have transitioned into a new era centered around young star Luka Dončić, who has quickly established himself as one of the league's premier players since being drafted in 2018. After a brief rebuilding phase following Nowitzki's retirement, the Mavericks returned to playoff contention and made a notable run to the NBA Finals again in 2024. With a strong roster that includes All-Star talents like Dončić and Kyrie Irving, the Mavericks continue to build on their legacy as a formidable franchise in the NBA landscape.</p>
