                Basketball is a dynamic team sport that combines skill, strategy, and athleticism. Played on a rectangular court, the objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing team's hoop, which is elevated 10 feet above the ground. Each team consists of five players who work together to dribble, pass, and shoot the ball while defending against their opponents.
